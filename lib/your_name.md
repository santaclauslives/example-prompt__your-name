# What is your name?

Patrick Downey Clark. It was Patrick Jeffrey Clark until I got married in 1986. Downey is my wife's family's last name. 
For class purposes, I respond to "Pat," Patrick" or sometimes "PC." 

If I was writing a program that returned my name, maybe this:

puts "What is your name?"
name = gets.chomp
puts "name"
